# kaggle's Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

This is my code for [kaggle's Product Classification Challenge][1]. I had a write-up about the solution in my blog. Check [My Solution to Kaggle's Otto Group Challenge][2].

This competition attracted me because:

* Lots of competitors and lots of solutions in the forum to learn from.
* Feature engineering was quite limited, thus I could focus on trying to use different models.
* A good chance to use model ensembling.

## Dependencies



## Run

* Put data into the `data` dir
* run `python ensembler.py`
